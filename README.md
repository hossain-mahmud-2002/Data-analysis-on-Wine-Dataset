Wine Quality Prediction

This project explores whether we can predict the quality of red and white wines using their chemical properties. After loading the dataset, I cleaned and prepared the data by fixing missing values, encoding the wine type, removing over a thousand duplicate rows, and scaling all numerical features.

I trained several machine learning models—Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM—to see which one performs best. Their performance was measured using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and learning curves.

To better understand the data, I also created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and a correlation heatmap. These helped reveal how features like alcohol, acidity, and sulphates relate to wine quality.

Overall, the project provides a full machine learning pipeline and highlights which factors influence wine quality the most.
